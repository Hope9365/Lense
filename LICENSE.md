# LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR [Lense]
Version 1.0 — <2026-01-23>

**Project:** `Lense` (“the Mod”)  
**Author:** `hope_zv(Hope9365)` (“the Author”)  
**Original GitHub Repository:** `https://github.com/Hope9365/Lense` (“Original Repo”)

## 0. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
Except for the permissions expressly granted by this license, **all rights are reserved** by the Author.

This license applies to the Mod’s **source code, binaries, and bundled assets** (art/sound/textures/etc.) unless a file or folder explicitly states otherwise.

---

## 1. Definitions
- **“You”**: any person or entity using, copying, modifying, distributing, or otherwise interacting with the Mod.
- **“Mod”**: this project, including its source code, binaries, and assets, as published by the Author in the Original Repo and/or official releases.
- **“Source Available”**: source code is publicly accessible online (no paywall, no invite-only, no “request access”), and includes the information reasonably needed to build (e.g., Gradle files).
- **“Derived Work”**: any fork, modification, port, remake, rewrite based on the Mod, or any work containing copied code/assets from the Mod.
- **“Addon”**: a separate mod/project intended to interoperate with or extend the Mod (including dependency-based addons), whether or not it copies code.
- **“Modpack”**: a curated collection of mods distributed as a pack/instance/profile (launcher pack, ZIP, manifest-based pack, etc.).
- **“Distribute” / “Redistribute”**: to provide copies to the public or third parties, including uploading to any site/platform, bundling, mirrors, launchers, or sending binaries.
- **“Functionally Equivalent Statement (FES)”**: a code fragment which, regardless of whitespace, formatting, identifiers, or superficial refactoring, achieves substantially the same result in substantially the same way within the context of a Minecraft mod/addon.

---

## 2. You MAY
2.1 **Use** the Mod privately and publicly (playing, running on servers, etc.).

2.2 **View and study** the source code, and **decompile** the binaries for learning/debugging.

2.3 **Fork and modify** the Mod.

2.4 **Submit Pull Requests** to the Original Repo.

2.5 **Create and distribute Modpacks** that include the Mod’s compiled jar **as part of the Modpack** (see Section 4).

2.6 **Create and distribute Forks, Addons and Derived Works**, but only if you follow all requirements in Sections 3–6 (open source + attribution + restrictions).

---

## 3. You MUST (Attribution)
If you Distribute any Derived Work, Fork, Addon, or Modpack containing the Mod, you MUST provide clear attribution:

3.1 **Credit line (required):**  
Include visible credit to the Author:  
`hope_zv(Hope9365) - (original author)` and a link to the Original Repo: `https://github.com/Hope9365/Lense`.

3.2 **Where attribution must appear:**
- For **Derived Works / Forks / Addons**: in the repository `README` (or equivalent), and in any public project page/description where downloads are offered.
- For **Modpacks**: in the Modpack description or manifest/credits page (where users normally read about included mods).

3.3 You MUST **not** imply the Author endorses your project/modpack unless you have explicit written permission.

---

## 4. Modpacks (Explicit Permission)
4.1 You MAY include the Mod’s **unmodified compiled jar** in a Modpack and Distribute that Modpack, provided that:
- the Mod is not presented as your work;
- attribution requirements in Section 3 are met; and
- the Modpack does **not** provide the Mod as a standalone download separate from the Modpack.

4.2 This permission is specifically intended to allow normal modpack distribution (launcher instances, zipped packs, server packs, etc.) where bundling the jar is required or customary.

---

## 5. You MUST (Open Source for forks/addons/derivatives)
5.1 If you Distribute any **Derived Work**, **Fork**, or **Addon**, you MUST make it **Source Available** in a publicly visible repository.

5.2 That public repository MUST:
- include the full corresponding source code for the distributed version;
- include this license text (or a verbatim copy clearly stating it is based on this license and preserving all restrictions);
- preserve copyright notices and attribution.

5.3 If you Distribute binaries (jar builds) of your Derived Work / Fork / Addon, you MUST provide a link to the corresponding public source repository in the same place you provide the download.

---

## 6. You CANNOT (No reuploads, no commercial distribution, no claiming ownership)
6.1 **No claiming ownership / no impersonation**  
You may not claim the Mod (or substantial parts of it) as your own work. You may not remove or alter copyright/author notices.

6.2 **No reuploads of the Mod**  
You may NOT rehost, reupload, mirror, or otherwise Redistribute the Mod (source or compiled), in whole or in part, on any third-party platform **as a standalone mod download**, including but not limited to mod hosting sites, file mirrors, “mod repost” sites, app stores, marketplaces, launchers’ internal catalogs, or paid/free content platforms — **even with attribution and links**.

**Exception:** distribution inside Modpacks as allowed by Section 4.

If you want to upload the Mod anywhere else, you must obtain **explicit written permission** from the Author.

6.3 **No commercial use**  
You may NOT sell, license for a fee, rent, paywall, or otherwise commercially monetize the Mod or any Derived Work/Addon based on it, including:
- charging for access to downloads;
- “early access” builds behind payment;
- bundling the Mod as a paid product component;
- selling the Mod itself or assets extracted from it.

**Allowed:** completely free Modpacks (no mandatory payment to access the pack).  
If you are unsure whether your distribution is “commercial”, assume it is and ask permission.

6.4 **No large-scale code copying (25% rule) and no copying of unique/complex parts**
You may NOT create or Distribute any project that contains:

**(A) 25% or more FES from the Mod**, measured as follows:
- Compare your project’s source code against the Mod’s source code (excluding comments, whitespace, and trivial formatting).
- If your project contains **FES-equivalent code matching 25% or more of the Mod’s non-comment source lines** (or an equivalent proportion of logic/classes), it is considered a violation.

**OR**

**(B) Any “Unique/Complex Section” copied from the Mod**, regardless of percentage.  
A “Unique/Complex Section” means code that is non-trivial and distinctive (e.g., custom algorithms, advanced mechanics implementations, complex systems, or sections that are clearly not boilerplate). Copying such sections into another project is prohibited even if it is less than 25%.

6.5 **No “rename and pretend it’s different”**
You may not circumvent Section 6.4 by renaming variables, rearranging code, changing formatting, or performing superficial refactors while keeping the logic functionally equivalent.

6.6 **Forks are okay, “code extraction” is not**
- Making a **fork/port** of the Mod (i.e., a Derived Work that remains essentially “this Mod, modified”) is allowed if it complies with Sections 3 and 5 and does not violate Sections 6.1–6.3.
- Extracting substantial parts of the Mod into an unrelated project is restricted by Section 6.4.

---

## 7. Contributions (Pull Requests)
By submitting a contribution (code, documentation, or assets) to the Original Repo, you agree that the Author may use, modify, and distribute your contribution as part of the Mod under this license (and/or future versions of this license published by the Author for this Mod).

---

## 8. Termination
Any violation of this license **automatically terminates** the permissions granted to You. Upon termination, you must immediately stop distribution and remove infringing uploads where possible.

---

## 9. Disclaimer
THE MOD IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE MOD OR ITS USE.
